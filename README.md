### I have no idea what I am doing

On a serious note, this is a poor attempt to get to know that bloody javaScript more.

A TicTacToe Basic game with a cheat function (user will know fast enough)

I did not want to cheat by using other javaScript plugins available in the internet

Not using Sass since the setup is taking time. Also not using Bootstrap or foundation, since I want to challenge myself to code HTML5 and CSS3 faster than my usual time.

Using:
- HTML5 (I think)
- CSS3 (I hope so)
- SVG
- No Images
- FontAwsome
- Underscore
- Poor man JavaScript

Hybrid of responsive and adaptive ( they only gave the student roughly 3 days... )
